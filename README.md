# **Enhanced AI-Driven Data Extraction Tool** ‚ú®

This project is a versatile tool designed to simplify and automate the extraction of meaningful data from web searches. By leveraging the **Hugging Face API**, **Google Search API**, and **LangChain**, users can define prompts to retrieve specific information such as email addresses, founder names, or any other custom data.

## **üöÄ Features**

### **1. Multiple Data Input Options**
- **CSV Upload**: Upload a CSV file directly from your local system.
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Load data from a Google Sheet by entering its ID.

### **2. Customizable Prompts for AI Extraction**
- Define multiple prompts to guide the AI in extracting specific details from web search results.
- Examples: *"Find the email address of {entity}"*, *"Extract the founder's name for {entity}"*.

### **3. AI-Powered Data Processing**
- Uses Google Search API to retrieve relevant results for the selected entities.
- Processes the results using **LangChain** and **Hugging Face's GPT-2** model to extract the required information.

### **4. Email Address Detection**
- Employs regular expressions to dynamically identify and extract email addresses from the AI's output.
- Stores the extracted emails in a separate column in the results dataset.

### **5. Export and Download Options**
- **CSV Export**: Download the extracted data in CSV format.
- **Google Sheets Export**: Directly export the results to a specified Google Sheet.

## **üìñ How It Works**

1. **Search Results Retrieval**:  
   - Fetches web search results for each entity using the SerpAPI.

2. **AI-Based Extraction**:  
   - Processes search results with Hugging Face's GPT-2 and LangChain for data extraction based on user-defined prompts.

3. **Email Extraction**:  
   - Dynamically identifies email addresses from the AI-generated text using regular expressions.

4. **Results Compilation**:  
   - Stores all extracted information, including emails, in a structured table.

5. **Export Options**:  
   - Allows downloading the results as a CSV file or exporting them to Google Sheets.
